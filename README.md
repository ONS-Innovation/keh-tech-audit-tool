# TECH AUDIT TOOL - UI

## Overview
The Tech Audit Tool is a tool used to survey out information such as the tools, languages and frameworks that are used by various projects within Digital Services and Technology (DST).

This data is used in the Tech Radar on the Digital Landscape to help ONS understand more about technology trends across the organisation.

An API runs in AWS, so there is no need to run the API locally when testing the UI.

## Getting Started
